**Authentication RESTful APIs with MongoDB, Express.js, and Node.js**

Welcome to the Authentication RESTful APIs repository, showcasing a robust authentication system built using MongoDB, Express.js, and Node.js (MERN stack). This project offers a comprehensive solution for implementing user authentication in web applications, providing secure access control and user management functionalities.

**Features:**

1. **Secure Authentication:** Experience a secure authentication system implemented with industry-standard encryption techniques, ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of user credentials.

2. **User Registration and Login:** Enable users to register for new accounts and securely log in to the application, with password hashing and salting to safeguard sensitive information.

3. **Token-based Authentication:** Implement token-based authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT), providing stateless authentication mechanisms for enhanced security and scalability.

4. **RESTful API Endpoints:** Accessible and well-documented RESTful API endpoints for user registration, login, logout, and profile management, facilitating seamless integration with frontend applications.

5. **Middleware Integration:** Utilize middleware functions in Express.js to handle authentication and authorization processes, ensuring secure access to protected routes and resources.

**Getting Started:**

To get started with the project:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory and install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Set up your MongoDB database and configure the connection string in the backend.
4. Customize authentication settings and security parameters as per your requirements.
5. Run the backend server using `npm start`.
6. Integrate the provided RESTful API endpoints into your frontend application for seamless user authentication and management.
